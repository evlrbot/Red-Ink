<h1>Welcome to Red Ink!</h1>
<p>There are a couple of steps necessary before you can get started working with your bank data.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Sign-up for an <a href='http://www.expensify.com' target='_blank'>Expensify</a> account.</b><br/> For most organizations and people, this is the best way to pass read-only bank data securely from you bank into the Red Ink system. If your bank is not supported by Expensify, please send us an e-mail letting us know. We are working on integrating with a variety of platforms, not just online banking.</li> 
   <li><b>Add your Expensify credentials to your <a href='me/account'>Account Settings</a>.</b><br/>This grants us read-only access to your data. We can't login to your bank. We can't make payments or transfer money. We just collect data from your statement. We only share that data when you authorize us to by joining a campaign.</li>
   <li><b>Finally, create or join a <a href='/campaign/index'>campaign</a>!</b><br/>Campaigns are ways of organizing people and data for aggregation, analysis and visualization. Define a set of transactions to look at and how you want to visualize them, then get people to join you by sharing their data.</li>
</ol>
